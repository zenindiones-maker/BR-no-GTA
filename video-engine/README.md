  <strong>A normal video editor — timeline, clips, cuts, transitions — except an AI can use it for you.</strong><br/>
  You say what you want in plain words. It does the editing while you watch the clips move, and you can grab the mouse and fix anything at any point.

## What it is

vedit is a video editor. The ordinary kind: a timeline, video and audio tracks, clips you
drag, cut, speed up, colour-grade and fade into each other.

The difference is that **everything you can do with the mouse, an AI can also do on command** —
because the buttons and the AI call the exact same 77 operations. Nothing is AI-only, nothing
is mouse-only.

So instead of half an hour of trimming, you type:

> *"Cut the first 40 seconds, remove the pauses where I say nothing, speed the screen recording
> up 2×, cut the b-roll on the beat of the music, and burn in subtitles."*

and the clips rearrange themselves on the timeline in front of you. If it puts a cut in the
wrong place, you drag that one clip and keep going. It is not a black box that hands you a
finished file you cannot touch — it is your editing software, with a second pair of hands.

## Who it is for

- **Anyone who edits talking-head, tutorial or gameplay video** and is tired of spending
  two hours on decisions that were never creative: finding the good take, cutting dead air,
  matching cuts to music, redoing the same volume curve.
- **People who already work with Claude Code, Cursor or Codex.** One line of setup and your
  coding agent can edit video, the same way it edits files.
- **Developers who want video editing in a script or a pipeline** — the whole project is a
  JSON document, so it can be generated, diffed and version-controlled like source code.

## Why use it instead of the alternatives

| | |
|---|---|
| **vs. "AI video generators"** | They give you a finished clip you cannot fix. vedit gives you the project, every clip, every knob — and the AI only moves the same controls you would have moved. |
| **vs. Premiere / DaVinci / CapCut** | Those give you every control and none of your time back. Here the boring 80 % is delegated and the last 20 % stays in your hands. |
| **vs. an ffmpeg script** | Same speed and precision, but you can actually see what happened, scrub it, and undo it. |
| **Cost and privacy** | Runs on your machine. No subscription, no upload, no watermark, no render queue. MIT licensed. |

```bash
claude mcp add vedit -- uvx vedit-mcp     # that is the whole install
```

> 🇮🇹 Questo README in italiano: [README.it.md](README.it.md). Code, comments and UI messages
> are in Italian — that is the project convention.

---

## What makes it work

An AI that cannot see the edit produces garbage. These are the parts that make the
difference between a demo and something you would actually cut a video with:

| | |
|---|---|
| **An agent can actually edit** | 77 MCP tools that are the *same* operations as the buttons: cut, split, speed, keyframes, effects, transitions, render. Nothing is agent-only, nothing is UI-only. |
| **The agent can see what it did** | `preview_frame` returns the **real rendered frame**, `preview_grid` the whole edit as a contact sheet. An agent that guesses produces garbage; this one looks. |
| **It cuts on the beat, for real** | `music_beats` returns BPM, beat and bar length, first-beat offset and an energy profile, so cuts land on the music instead of near it. |
| **It picks the takes** | `plan_edit` splits shots longer than 12s into their own segments and scores them individually — three minutes of continuous footage becomes dozens of candidates with a real in-point. |
| **Same project, same file** | The render is deterministic. No hidden state, no "works in the preview, breaks on export". |
| **You keep the timeline** | Whatever the agent does shows up in the web UI, on the same in-memory project, and undoes with one Ctrl+Z. |

## Install

### Just to use it — nothing to clone

The package is on PyPI as **`vedit-mcp`** (the name `vedit` was taken; the Python module is
still `vedit`). The compiled web interface ships **inside the package**, so there is no build
step:

```bash
claude mcp add vedit -- uvx vedit-mcp        # Claude Code: one line
uvx --from vedit-mcp vedit ui                # or just the web editor
```

Same JSON for every other client (Cursor `.cursor/mcp.json`, Codex, VS Code):

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "vedit": { "command": "uvx", "args": ["vedit-mcp"] } } }
```

You need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (`pipx install uv`,
`winget install astral-sh.uv`, `brew install uv`). Prefer a classic install?
`pipx install vedit-mcp`, then `vedit` and `vedit-mcp` are on your `PATH`.

**ffmpeg** is the one thing pip cannot bring along — it is a program, not a Python package.
If it is missing, don't go hunting: `vedit install-ffmpeg` downloads a static build of ffmpeg
*and* ffprobe into `~/.vedit/bin`. No administrator rights, no system changes, uninstalled by
deleting the folder. The agent has the same thing as the `install_ffmpeg` tool. If ffmpeg is
already on your `PATH`, that one wins — it usually has more hardware encoders.

### To hack on it — one command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/metiu1/editorvideo-ai.git
cd editorvideo-ai
python scripts/setup.py
```

The script does everything: Python dependencies, compiled web interface, MCP server
registered, then `vedit doctor` and the fast tests as verification. It prints one line per
step and ends by telling you what is still missing and how to fix it. Re-running it is safe —
anything already in place is skipped.

```bash
python scripts/setup.py --venv             # dependencies in .venv instead of the current interpreter
python scripts/setup.py --install-ffmpeg   # try winget / brew / apt
python scripts/setup.py --no-frontend      # CLI and MCP only, no web interface
python scripts/setup.py --rebuild          # rebuild the UI after touching frontend/src
python scripts/setup.py --json             # machine-readable result, for scripts and agents
```

Then `vedit ui` → <http://127.0.0.1:8760>.

### Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| Python | 3.10+ |
| ffmpeg + ffprobe | on `PATH`, downloaded with `vedit install-ffmpeg`, or pointed at with `VEDIT_FFMPEG` / `VEDIT_FFPROBE` |
| Node.js | 18+, **only** to compile the interface from source the first time |
| GPU | optional. NVIDIA / Intel / AMD are detected and used for rendering automatically |

### Optional extras

Everything below is optional; without them the rest of the editor behaves identically and the
tools that need them say what to install.

```bash
pip install -e ".[chat]"        # anthropic — the chat assistant inside the UI (+ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
pip install -e ".[vision]"      # ultralytics — detect_subjects, track_mask, auto_reframe (pulls torch)
pip install -e ".[transcribe]"  # faster-whisper — transcribe, make_captions, tighten_speech, censor_speech
```

`numpy` and Pillow are **not** extras: footage analysis, music-timed editing, `preview_grid`
and `color_scopes` stand on them, and looking at your edit is rule number one.

---

## Quick start

End to end, three commands:

```bash
vedit new film.json --preset 1080p
vedit import film.json shots/*.mp4 music.mp3 && vedit info film.json   # prints media ids
vedit add film.json <media_id> --duration 3 && vedit render film.json out.mp4
```

Or open the editor and do it by hand:

```bash
vedit ui                                     # http://127.0.0.1:8760
vedit ui --project film.json                 # opening a project directly
vedit ui --port 9000 --no-browser
```

The `.json` **is** the project: your video files stay where they are, nothing is copied.
Format presets: `1080p`, `1080p60`, `4k`, `720p`, `vertical` (9:16, for reels and shorts),
`vertical60`, `square`.

---

## Driving it from an agent (MCP)

`.mcp.json` is already in the repo, so opening this folder in Claude Code offers the `vedit`
server on first launch (approve it once). Anywhere else:

```bash
claude mcp add vedit -- uvx vedit-mcp
```

Typical tool flow:

```
project_create → import_media → plan_edit (choose the material) → add_clips
   → refine (set_transition, set_speed, set_transform, add_effect, set_audio)
   → preview_grid to look at it → render_video
```

Times are in seconds. Every animatable parameter also accepts a keyframe block —
`{"kf": [{"t": 0, "v": 0}, {"t": 2, "v": 1, "ease": "ease_in_out"}]}`, with `t` relative to
the start of the clip. `project_info` returns the timeline state with ids.

**Cutting many clips:** use `add_clips`, which places all cuts in a single atomic call. One
call per cut is slow, floods the undo history for what is one gesture, and leaves half a
timeline behind if something breaks midway.

```json
[{"media": "m1b1a", "start": 0.0, "in": 122.5, "duration": 1.5},
 {"media": "m9155", "start": 1.5, "in": 98.5,  "duration": 0.75}]
```

**Showing the result:** `open_ui` starts the web interface **inside the MCP server process**
and returns the address. It is not a second instance — the UI works on the *same* `Store`
object as the agent, and every change shows up in the browser live. One writer, no file
contention. `close_ui` shuts it down.

**The editing rules ship with the server.** `mcp_server.ISTRUZIONI` states them, so they reach
any client, and they are there because they are the actual defects of videos that come out of
here — decisions not made, not tool limits:

1. **the music must move** — a fixed volume for the whole duration is the first thing that
   makes a video feel flat; automate the gain with keyframes and pick the section with
   `music_beats`;
2. **not every cut is a hard cut** — the hard cut is the default, not the only option; every
   transition still needs a reason;
3. **never the same shot twice** — if the material is not enough, make the video shorter;
4. **after ten seconds you owe the viewer new information** — cutting faster on the same
   images saves nothing;
5. **cinematic is a choice, not a filter** — one strong moment held for three seconds beats
   ten half-seconds.

Full agent contract, including the code map and the rules for modifying it:
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) (imported by `CLAUDE.md`, so it applies to Claude Code, Codex, Cursor
and the rest).

> **One project per file at a time.** The UI and the MCP server both autosave; if you keep the
> same `.json` open in two processes, the last one to save wins. With `open_ui` the problem
> does not arise.

Panels resize by dragging the dividers, and the sizes are remembered.

**1. Media.** `+` imports files *leaving them where they are*. Dragging files from the desktop
**copies** them into `media/` next to the project (the browser does not hand over the source
path) — for heavy files use `+`. `📁+` creates a folder, which is just a label on the media.
Click opens a media in the *source* monitor, double click appends it to the timeline, drag
puts it exactly where you want.

**2. Library.** Pre-tuned looks, audio chains and transitions, with a name instead of twenty
parameters: colour looks (cinema teal & orange, black and white, warm sunset, faded film…),
stylised (VHS, dream, censor), retouch (sharpen, clean up, vignette, stabilise); voice and
music chains; dissolve, iris, wipe and slide in four directions. Click applies to the selected
clip — a video look with nothing selected goes on the **master**, i.e. the whole video. Drag a
preset **onto a clip** to apply it there. A preset is only a chain of effects: one Ctrl+Z
undoes it and every parameter stays editable.

**3. Monitor and preview.** Two tabs: *program* (the timeline) and *source* (one media alone).
When paused, the preview is the frame **rendered by ffmpeg**, so it is identical to the final
result, effects included. ▶ plays 12-second segments while preparing the next one in the
background; hit **proxy** in the top bar to make everything much faster. With a clip selected
you get the transform box: drag the image to move it, the corners to scale it. In the *source*
monitor, `[` and `]` mark in and out, then **insert** puts just that piece at the playhead.

**4. Timeline and tracks.** Track count is **not fixed**: a new project has one video and one
audio track, and you add more with `+ video` / `+ audio`. Every track header carries: rename
(double click), ▲▼ to reorder (for video, order **is** the stacking — higher = drawn on top),
👁/🔊 hide or mute, **S** for solo, 🔒 lock (protects clips from moves, cuts, effects and
deletion), ✕ delete, and a volume slider. A track excluded from the render is visibly faded
with a struck-through name; a locked one is hatched. Clips drag between tracks, edges trim,
snapping catches other clips and the playhead, video clips show filmstrips and audio clips
their waveform.

**5. Properties.** With a clip selected: name, start, duration, in-point, framing, speed and
reverse, fades, outgoing transition, position / scale / rotation / opacity, audio (gain in dB,
pan, fades), effects. The **◆** button next to a parameter makes it **animated** and opens the
keyframe editor, with times relative to the start of the clip. With nothing selected you get
the project: resolution, fps, background, EBU R128 normalisation of the mix, master effects.

**6. Assistant.** Ask for a change in plain language and it happens on the project — "drop the
first 2 seconds of the first clip", "dissolve between the two shots", "move the music to its
own track and take it down 6 dB". Its tools **are the same operations as the buttons**: what it
does appears in the timeline and undoes with Ctrl+Z, exactly like your own edit. Requires
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; without it, the tab explains why it is off and nothing else is affected.

**7. Export.** Destination file, quality (`draft` / `medium` / `high` / `max`), codec (H.264,
HEVC, AV1, VP9), optionally just a portion of the timeline. The extension picks the container:
`.mp4` `.mov` `.mkv` `.webm` `.gif` `.mp3` `.wav`. The progress bar is ffmpeg's real progress.
The final render **always uses the originals**, never the proxies.

vedit effects video                      # effect catalogue with parameters
vedit doctor                             # ffmpeg, encoders, filters
vedit install-ffmpeg                     # download ffmpeg + ffprobe into ~/.vedit/bin
vedit ui                                 # web interface
```

## What it can do

**Editing** — cut, split, trim, move (across tracks too), ripple delete, close gaps, any number
of video and audio tracks with ordering, solo and lock, bin folders, undo/redo.

**Transitions** — dissolve, wipe in four directions, slide in four directions, iris. The next
clip is pulled in and overlapped automatically; audio always crossfades.

**Speed** — 0.01x to 100x with pitch-correct audio (chained `atempo`), reverse, motion blur or
frame interpolation for slow motion.

**Colour** — brightness, contrast, saturation, gamma (all animatable), shadow/midtone/highlight
balance, temperature, curves, `.cube` LUTs, `match_color` between shots, `color_scopes`.

**Composition** — position, scale, rotation and opacity per clip, all animatable with keyframes
and easing; PiP, graphic overlays, text with box/outline/shadow, chroma key, crop, mirror,
pixelate, vignette, grain, glow, stabilisation.

**Audio** — gain in dB (animatable), pan, fades, EQ, compressor, limiter, noise reduction, gate,
reverb, echo, pitch shift, dynamic normalisation, and two-pass EBU R128 normalisation of the
mix; `duck_music`, `jl_cut`, `detach_audio`.

**Footage and rhythm** — `plan_edit` (segment and score the takes), `inspect_footage`,
`music_beats` (BPM, bars, energy profile, cut grid), `check_cuts`, `smooth_cuts`,
`preview_grid`, `verify_edit`.

**Speech and subject** *(extras)* — `transcribe`, `make_captions`, `tighten_speech`,
`censor_speech`; `detect_subjects`, `track_mask`, `auto_reframe`.

---

## Keyframes

Any animatable parameter accepts a keyframe block instead of a number:

```json
{"kf": [{"t": 0, "v": 1.0, "ease": "ease_in_out"}, {"t": 3, "v": 1.4}]}
```

`t` is **relative to the start of the clip**. Easing: `linear`, `hold`, `ease_in`, `ease_out`,
`ease_in_out` and the `_cubic` variants.

Keyframes become ffmpeg expressions evaluated frame by frame, so animation does not cost an
extra render pass.

---

## How it works

```
backend/vedit/
  model.py       project document (dataclass ↔ JSON)
  keyframes.py   keyframes → ffmpeg expressions
  effects.py     effect registry: parameters, validation, filters
  presets.py     pre-tuned looks, audio chains and transitions
  graph.py       timeline → filter_complex
  render.py      execution, progress, analysis (loudness, stabilisation)
  proxy.py       proxies, waveforms, thumbnails
  store.py       editing operations + undo/redo + atomic save
  chat.py        assistant: its tools are Store's operations
  mcp_server.py  MCP tools
  api.py         REST/WebSocket API for the UI
  cli.py         command line
frontend/        web interface (React + Vite)
tests/           tests, including real renders of every effect
```

**One source of truth.** The interface, the assistant and the MCP agent all call methods on
`Store`. There is no privileged path for modifying the project, so there is no "works from
here, breaks from there". Add an operation to `store.py` first, then expose it where needed —
never write into the document from `api.py`, `mcp_server.py` or `cli.py`.

The less obvious choices, and why:

- **Composition**: a canvas plus one `overlay` per clip. Handles multi-track, PiP and
  dissolves with no special cases.
- **Placement**: `tpad` with transparent frames instead of shifting PTS, so `overlay` never
  sits waiting for frames.
- **Draw order**: video tracks stack in list order. Inside a track the clip that starts first
  is on top (so its outgoing transition reveals the next one); titles and solid colours are the
  exception and always sit above media.
- **Preview**: `slice_project` cuts out the requested portion, so rendering second 300 costs no
  more than second 3. Sliced clips keep their original timing, so a dissolve framed halfway
  shows the right frame — there is a test comparing preview against final render.
- **Transitions**: they exploit the draw order. Wipes and iris erase pixels of the outgoing
  clip with a `geq` alpha mask; slides add a term to the overlay's `x`/`y` expressions. No
  second branch in the graph, no extra composition cost.
- **Filmstrips**: one image per media (`tile`), positioned with CSS from in-point, speed and
  zoom. Zooming the timeline issues no requests at all.
- **Preview cache**: every frame and segment is written to a temporary file and moved into
  place only when finished. Otherwise the player would get an mp4 with no `moov` atom yet and
  playback would not start.
- **Saving**: same idea, atomic `os.replace`. An interruption cannot leave a truncated project.
- **Filtergraph from file** (`-filter_complex_script`): long timelines blow past Windows'
  32k command-line limit.

## Tests

```bash
pytest                  # everything, real renders included (3–5 min)
pytest -m "not slow"    # logic and API, no renders (2–3 min)

cd frontend
node test-util.mjs                       # pure UI functions
npm run build && node smoke.mjs          # mounts the built UI in jsdom
```

**ffmpeg is needed even by the fast tests**: `tests/conftest.py` generates synthetic sources
with it, and half the suite reads media with ffprobe. The `slow` marker separates real
*renders*, not the use of ffmpeg.

The suite covers keyframes, editing operations, graph compilation, a real render for each
effect and each transition, preview-versus-final-render agreement, MCP tools, the UI API and
the command line. `tests/test_dipendenze.py` reads the backend's imports and requires each one
to be declared in `pyproject.toml`, so a package that happens to sit on a developer's machine
cannot silently go missing from the wheel.

---

## Known limits

- Animated opacity and wipes use `geq` (per-pixel evaluation): they work, but they slow the
  render down. Dissolves and slides do not carry that cost.
- Animated scale goes through `zoompan`: below 0.25x the value is clamped.
- Preview playback is segmented: the first segment has to be waited for, the following ones are
  prepared while you watch.
- Files dragged from the desktop are copied (the browser does not pass the source path); for
  large files use the import button.
- The transform box does not edit animated parameters — for those, use the keyframes.
- If two processes hold the same `.json` open, one autosave can overwrite the other's work.
  There is no project-file lock yet.

## FAQ

**Does it upload my footage anywhere?**
No. Everything runs on your machine: ffmpeg does the work, the project is a local `.json`, the
media never leaves the folder it is in. The only thing that talks to the network is the
optional chat assistant (your own Anthropic key) and `install-ffmpeg`, which downloads ffmpeg.

**Do I need a GPU?**
No. If you have one (NVIDIA / Intel / AMD) it is detected and used for encoding automatically;
without one everything still works, renders just take longer.

**Which agents can drive it?**
Any MCP client: Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Codex, VS Code, or your own via the MCP
SDK. `claude mcp add vedit -- uvx vedit-mcp`, or the equivalent JSON in the client's config.

**Is this "AI generated video"?**
No. Nothing is generated — it edits *your* footage with ffmpeg. The AI part is the agent
deciding *where to cut*, and you can see and undo every decision in the timeline.

**Does the agent edit blind?**
It doesn't have to: `preview_frame` returns the real rendered frame and `preview_grid` the
whole edit as a contact sheet, so the agent looks at its own work before rendering.

**What if ffmpeg is missing?**
`vedit install-ffmpeg` puts a static ffmpeg + ffprobe in `~/.vedit/bin`. No admin rights, no
system changes, removed by deleting the folder.

**Can I use it without the agent, as a normal editor?**
Yes — `vedit ui` is a full timeline editor with tracks, keyframes, effects and export. MCP is
one of three front ends, not a requirement.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). In short:

- read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — it is the contract for humans and coding agents alike;
- code, comments and user-facing messages are **in Italian**, like the rest of the project
  (this README and the docs are the English front door);
- every new behaviour comes with a test; real renders go behind the `slow` marker;
- new effect → `effects.py`; new MCP tool → a method in `store.py`, a wrapper in
  `mcp_server.py`, a test in `tests/test_mcp.py`; UI change → `npm run build`;
- before claiming it works: `pytest -m "not slow"` plus the part of `slow` it touches, and
  `cd frontend && npm test` if you changed the UI.
